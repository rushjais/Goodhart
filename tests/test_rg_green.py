"""Step 1 (Track RG): the green-patch target on a REAL RL reward (reasoning-gym / gsm_symbolic).

No LLM, no red agent — hand fixtures that retire the unknown and SHOW the core dynamic on the
LENIENT (gameable) naive grader: reasoning-gym's default substring scorer (gold appears anywhere
-> credit). It passes honest step-by-step answers (real honest-pass baseline) AND is gameable, so
an over-tightening patch is caught by the regression gate / honest-pass, then a better, non-circular
patch seals the cheat while honest-pass holds.

Reused unchanged from the code-grader loop: `grade`, `apply_patch`, `regression_gate`,
`agreement`, `honest_pass`, `is_breach`. Only the patch *target* (parse-tightening) is new.
