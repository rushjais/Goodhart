"""Oracle: the held-out ground-truth verdict T in {0,1}.

plus_input and canonical_solution are read from the in-memory Task ONLY. Expected outputs
are derived by running the gold over plus_input in-process; the agent's solution.py is then
evaluated against them in a fresh dir OUTSIDE the agent's workdir. The oracle never writes
the gold or the plus inputs into the workdir or anywhere the agent could read (SPEC §4).
The oracle uses plus_input only; the grader uses base_input only — zero shared cases
(eval-honesty invariant #2).
