"""DEV STUBS (Track B, local-only). Swap for `goodhart.loop.interface` at first
integration (~hour 5), when Track A's real grader/harness lands.

B.0 prescribes a trivial stub grader so the red-agent loop can be built before the
real grader exists. These are CONSTANTS — they assert nothing about real breaches;
that confirmation happens against Track A's deterministic grader/oracle. Never let a
stub leak into the metric path (eval honesty is Track A's, measured for real).
