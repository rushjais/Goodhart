"""The golden siege story — one hand-authored run that exercises all 7 Seam 2 events.

This is the source of truth for `golden_run.jsonl` and the fixture the dashboard renders
against before the live engine exists. It depicts the swarm as the conductor would drive it:
the specialists *converge* on the softest gate, and once a gate is turreted they *redirect*
to the next soft spot — visibly skipping hardened gates rather than wandering. The numbers
tell an honest arc: a weak grader (42% agreement) is breached three ways and hardened to 97%
with honest-pass held at 100% (one over-tightened patch is caught and torn down). Numbers move
only via `robustness_update`; nothing downstream is hardcoded.
