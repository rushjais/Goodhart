"""Golden replay — feed a recorded JSONL run onto the bus, decoupled from the live engine.

The dashboard speaks only websocket JSON and cannot tell replay from a live run: both pass
through the same EventBus and the same serializer. Replay reconstructs each locked dataclass
via `from_wire`, so a malformed golden line fails loudly here instead of reaching the UI.
