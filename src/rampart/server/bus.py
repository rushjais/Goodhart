"""In-process event bus: the engine emits Seam 2 events, websocket clients consume them.

`to_wire`/`from_wire` are the single serialization path shared by live, replay, and
recording, so the wire format can never drift between them. `from_wire` rebuilds the
locked dataclass by its `type` tag, which doubles as a schema check on replayed data.
The bus knows nothing about the engine, FastAPI, or files.
