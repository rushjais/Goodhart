"""End-to-end RAMPART pipeline over an environment adapter — bring an env, get a verifier report.

An environment is just an **adapter**: how to list tasks, the verifier under test (`naive`), an
**independent** oracle (ground truth), and optionally the hardened verifier + a guaranteed cheat
injector. Given one, the SAME loop generates the adversarial rollout and produces the
verifier-safety leaderboard + best-of-K gap — for EvalPlus, reasoning-gym, or a HUD environment.

The one hard requirement is that `oracle` is independent of `naive` (else you grade the verifier
against a copy of itself). See SPEC eval-honesty. Adding an env = writing one adapter.
