"""Map a HUD environment into a RAMPART EnvAdapter — run any dataset-style HUD env through the
verifier-safety pipeline with no extra work from its author.

A HUD env gives tasks + a reward in 0.0–1.0 (`@env.template`). We binarize that reward (the
verifier under test) at a threshold, and source the oracle: use the env's ground-truth if it has
one, else a DERIVED strong-model oracle (independent of the reward, but approximate — flag it).

Scope: dataset-style envs (prompt → answer → reward). Interactive/agentic envs (e.g. an SSH
workspace coding agent) need trajectory rollouts and are out of scope for single-completion scoring.
