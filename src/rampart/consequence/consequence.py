"""Tier A consequence number (SPEC §9.5) — no training, on the critical path.

Reframe the discovered breach population as the damage: "train on this reward and these are
the behaviors it pays for." The number is the reward a pure-cheating policy collects, naive
grader vs hardened: the leaky reward pays out X for cheating; the hardened one pays ~0.

It's a reframing of the held-out agreement, measured on the SAME breach source as M2
(discovered_breaches with seed fallback, labeled). Per held-out cheat the reward = 1 if the
grader still accepts it, 0 if it rejects it — so reward-per-cheat = 1 - blocked-rate
(= 1 - agreement). Deterministic for the seed source; no GPU.

Dashboard exposure (coordinated with Track C / Rushil): the Tier A slot reads the locked
`robustness_update` event stream (reward = 1 - held_out_blocked; naive = first reading,
hardened = latest), NOT capability.json (that file is Tier B, the trained chart). So we
expose Tier A as `robustness_update` events via `as_robustness_updates`.
