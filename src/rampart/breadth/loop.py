"""Milestone 2: run the M1 loop across an EvalPlus subset + the exploitability hit-rate.

Per task: split plus_input into two disjoint halves — one used for hardening, the other as
the held-out oracle — so the grader and the oracle share ZERO cases (invariant #2). Seed the
breaches with the generic forger (or consume an injected discover_fn supplied by the
engine/CLI), validate them as genuine (R=1 AND T=0), split train/held-out, accept a patch via
the regression gate on TRAIN only, then measure agreement before/after on the held-out split
with honest_pass beside it.

This module is pure spine/metrics: it never imports the engine (agents). The red swarm is
injected as `discover_fn` by the composition root (the CLI), and spine deps reach it through
the loop.interface seam, not the engine.

Tasks are independent, so they run in parallel; results are placed in task order and all
splits are deterministic, so the aggregate is reproducible.
