"""Substrate for a REAL RL reward: reasoning-gym (`gsm_symbolic`, GSM8K-style math).

Parallel to `evalplus_task` but for a string-answer environment. The candidate "solution" is
an answer STRING (not code in a workdir); the naive grader is reasoning-gym's OWN shipped
`score_answer` (first-number-anywhere == gold — the leniency is the environment's, not ours).

Eval honesty: the oracle here (`rg_oracle`) is the answer's FINAL number == gold — a deliberately
DIFFERENT, independent standard from the weak first-number grader, so they never coincide. Train
vs held-out is split by disjoint seeds (`load_rg_subset(seed=A)` vs `seed=B`).
