"""Seam 1 — the locked function contract.

The whole loop is now implemented (Track A), so this module re-exports the real impls:
every track calls the loop through this one contract instead of reaching into
`substrate`/`harness`/`grader`/`oracle`/`templates`/`gate`/`metrics` directly.

Seam drift (flagged for the team): the real `run_oracle(task, workdir)` takes the task
(the gold/plus_input live on it, never in the workdir), so the re-exported signature is
(task, workdir) — not the doc's original `run_oracle(workdir)`. Reconciled here to match
the implementation since nothing called the old shape yet.
