"""A second BASELINE verifier: the LLM-as-judge grader.

Instead of running tests, ask an LLM 'does this solution correctly and generally solve the
task?' and use that as pass/fail. This is the popular 'just use an LLM to grade' approach — a
FOIL we measure against, NOT the product verdict path (SPEC keeps LLM-judge out of the core:
it's non-deterministic). The point of the comparison: every off-the-shelf verifier (sparse
tests OR a raw LLM judge) has failure modes; our loop hardens the test grader into something
deterministic and trustworthy.
